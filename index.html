    <h3>McDonald&rsquo;s, Montgomery IL</h3>
    <h4>June 12, 2019 to Nov 12, 2020</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Custodian: Lobby. By the second day on the job, both Hiring Manager and
        Store Manager said that work was outstanding; both stated that customers
        had been complaining but were now complimenting the cleanliness of the
        restaurant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dozens of customers have complimented work, thanked me for providing a
        much cleaner lobby, and left high scores for cleanliness of restaurant
        in McDonald’s surveys. Have been told more than once that the Boulder
        Hill location is now considered to have the cleanest McDonald’s lobby in
        the area.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thanked by Head Regional Manager for keeping restrooms so clean;
        customers have told her that restrooms at this location have never been
        this clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a fire at this location, worked at the McDonald&rsquo;s on Route
        34 (Oswego location). Cleaned lobby to the same level as the Boulder
        Hill lobby- management has kept cleanliness at the level I helped
        establish. Management commented that I have good customer service skills
        and that I am very friendly with customers. My performance led to an
        eventual job offer at that McDonald&rsquo;s on November 5, 2021.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taken orders on both the registers and the kiosks, and assisted
        customers in using them- taught myself to use the kiosks the second week
        on the job and have helped several customers learn to use the kiosks
        themselves. Have logged many hours on the kiosks and on the registers at
        the front counter and drive-through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taken orders at the drive-through and assisted customers with choices or
        substitutes. With lobby shut down, due to COVID-19 virus, spent the last
        few months taking drive-through orders, and have logged many hours in
        this capacity. Received several enthusiastic compliments from customers,
        and one manager stated that I am fast at taking orders, while another
        has mentioned my accuracy. Sold over 160 donations for the Ronald
        McDonald House, which accounted for around 95% of donations in that
        store. Was on track to become a manager because of customer-service
        skills.
